# Bones Against Sheets (prev Skelrun)


Last updates:

1. Now ghosts are shooting. Bullets go in direction to the player. Ghosts start shooting from random distance to the player.
2. Ghosts fall down from top after the player come closer so it bring more adrenalin ;)
3. Added a finish point. It is a rotate black hole.
4. Moved functions (ghosts, collisions, process, loadGame, doRender) from main.c into different files
